Students Performance dataset is a kaggle dataset  https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
in this repo I tend to answer these two questions:
1- Is there a differences between studentsâ€™ gender in the overall score performance?
2- If it so, is that apply in all subjects individually.
