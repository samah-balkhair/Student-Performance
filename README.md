Students Performance dataset is a kaggle dataset. You can find the source of dataset from here  https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

As we have a stereotype saying that the female always exceed the male in academic score, I will attemp to answer this question:

Is there a significant impact in the overall score for the student based on the student gender?
